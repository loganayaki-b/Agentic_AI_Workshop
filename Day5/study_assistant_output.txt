üìö Summary:
Here's a concise bullet point summary of the provided prompt engineering study material:

**I. Introduction to Prompt Engineering**

*   **Prompts:** Instructions and context given to a language model (LM) to achieve a task.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Developing and optimizing prompts for efficient LM use.
*   **Importance:** Crucial for research, testing LM limitations, and enabling innovative applications.
*   **Decoding Parameters:**
    *   **Temperature:** Controls randomness (0-1). Lower = Sharper, more repetitive. Higher = More diverse.
    *   **Top P:** Selects tokens with cumulative probability exceeding p (0-1). Lower = More repetitive.
*   **Prompt Elements:** Instructions, context, input data, output indicator.
*   **Settings:** Temperature and Top_p affect determinism. Keep low for exact answers, high for diverse responses.

**II. Designing Prompts for Different Tasks**

*   **Common Tasks:** Text summarization, question answering, text classification, role playing, code generation, reasoning.
*   **Examples:** The slides provide examples of prompts for each task, demonstrating how to structure the prompt with context and instructions.

**III. Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques**

*   **Few-Shot Prompts:** Provide examples in the prompt to guide the model.
*   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:** Instruct the model to reason step-by-step. Can be combined with few-shot or used in a zero-shot manner ("Let's think step by step").
*   **Self-Consistency:** Sample multiple reasoning paths using CoT and select the most consistent answer.
*   **Knowledge Generation Prompting:** Generate additional knowledge as part of the context to improve results.
*   **Program-Aided Language Model (PAL):** Uses an LLM to generate programs as intermediate reasoning steps, offloading the solution to a runtime environment (e.g., Python).
*   **ReAct:** Interleaves reasoning traces and task-specific actions, allowing interaction with external tools.
*   **Directional Stimulus Prompting:** Uses a tuneable policy LM to generate hints that guide a black-box frozen LLM.

**IV. Risks**

*   **Prompt Injection:** Hijacking LM output by injecting untrusted commands.
*   **Prompt Leaking:** Forcing the model to reveal information about its own prompt.
*   **Jailbreaking:** Bypassing safety and moderation features.
