# Research Report on: Climate Change

## Introduction
This report provides an overview of key questions related to **Climate Change**.

### 1. Here are 5 diverse research questions on the topic of Climate Change, spanning different areas of inquiry:
- **[PDF] Psychology and Global Climate Change**: – the anxieties, the extreme weather events, the dislocations, and the increased social inequality. While this report highlights many areas of existing knowledge (e.g., psychosocial impacts of natural disasters and attitudes and behaviors toward perceived environmental threats), the challenge is to test theory and interventions in the domain of climate change. Research questions can include: • How is the response to environmental problems that result from climate change similar to the response [...] change?; 5. Which Psychological Barriers Limit Climate Change Action? 6. How Can Psychologists Assist in Limiting Climate Change? These questions follow mental models of hazards that include identification of the problem, causes, consequences, and controls or solutions (Bostrom & Lashof, 2007). The first question examines psychological processes that influence answers to the remaining questions. The second question addresses psychological understanding of human causes or drivers of climate [...] types of research questions that could be addressed: • Research is needed to test the applicability of psychological risk dimensions such as perceived controllability to the domain of climate change; • Research is needed to better understand discounting of environmental costs and benefits relative to the discounting of economic or social costs and benefits; • Research is need on the finite pool of worry effect, i.e., interactions between perceptions of other classes of risk (e.g., economic

### 2. **How will the projected changes in precipitation patterns associated with climate change impact the agricultural productivity and food security of vulnerable populations in Sub-Saharan Africa over the next 50 years?** (Focuses on impacts, specific region, and temporal scope)
- **Effects of climate change on agriculture in Africa | McKinsey**: **Climate change is expected to make agricultural development** in Africa more challenging. Weather patterns are becoming less favorable in many instances, increasing the volatility of crop and livestock yields. The frequency and/or severity of extreme events is increasing as temperatures are projected to continue rising, and rainfall patterns are expected to shift more than they have already (Exhibit 1).

### 3. **To what extent can nature-based solutions, such as afforestation and wetland restoration, effectively sequester carbon dioxide and mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on biodiversity at a global scale?** (Focuses on mitigation strategies, quantifiable results, and ecosystem impacts)
- **Biodiversity - our strongest natural defense against climate change**: Protecting, managing, and restoring [forests](https://www.un-redd.org/), for example, offers roughly two-thirds of the total mitigation potential of all nature-based solutions. Despite massive and ongoing losses, forests still cover more than 30 per cent of the planet’s land. [...] When human activities produce greenhouse gases, around half of the emissions remain in the atmosphere, while the other half is [absorbed by the land and ocean](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/five-ecosystems-where-nature-based-solutions-can-deliver-huge-benefits). These ecosystems – and the biodiversity they contain – are natural carbon sinks, providing so-called nature-based solutions to climate change. [...] [Conserving and restoring natural spaces](https://wedocs.unep.org/xmlui/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/35360/NatClim.pdf), both on land and in the water, is essential for limiting carbon emissions and adapting to an already changing climate. About [one-third of the greenhouse gas emissions reductions needed](https://www.unep.org/resources/factsheet/nature-climate-action) in the next decade could be achieved by improving nature’s ability to absorb emissions.

### 4. **What are the psychological and behavioral barriers hindering individual adoption of sustainable practices, and how can targeted communication strategies overcome these barriers to promote widespread climate action?** (Focuses on human behavior, behavioral economics, and communication strategies)
- **What Psychological Factors Hinder Climate Action? → Question**: ### Overcoming the Barriers

Acknowledging these psychological barriers is crucial. By understanding why people are reluctant to act, we can develop more effective strategies to promote climate action. This might involve framing climate change as a local and immediate issue, highlighting the benefits of sustainable behaviors, and fostering a sense of collective responsibility. [...] One of the primary [psychological barriers Meaning → Psychological Barriers denote the cognitive, emotional, and social constructs that impede individuals and collectives from adopting behaviors conducive to sustainability.](https://lifestyle.sustainability-directory.com/area/psychological-barriers/)  is the perception of **Distance**. [Climate change Meaning → Long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns, primarily due to human-induced greenhouse gas [...] **Loss Aversion**, a well-documented cognitive bias, suggests that people feel the pain of a loss more strongly than the pleasure of an equivalent gain. This bias can explain why individuals are reluctant to adopt sustainable behaviors that might involve perceived sacrifices or inconveniences, even if the long-term benefits outweigh the short-term costs. The **Status Quo Bias**, a related concept, describes the tendency to prefer the current state of affairs, even when change might be

**6. Optimism Bias & Toxic Positivity** [...] **11. Overwhelmed and** **Powerlessness**

Many people are so overwhelmed trying to survive and succeed within our hyper-individualistic, capitalist system that they do not have any bandwidth left for activism. Many have resigned themselves to the fate chosen by big business and politicians who minimize climate science and bypass the will of the people.

**12. Learned Helplessness**
- **Psychological barriers moderate the attitude-behavior gap for ...**: Behavioral change has been increasingly recognized as a means for combating climate change. However, being concerned about climate problems and knowing the importance of individual actions in mitigating them is not enough for greater adherence to a more sustainable lifestyle. Psychological barriers such as (1) finding change unnecessary; (2) conflicting goals; (3) interpersonal relationships; (4) lack of knowledge; and (5) tokenism have been proposed as an explanation for the gap between

### 5. **How does the political polarization surrounding climate change influence the implementation and effectiveness of climate policies at both national and international levels, and what strategies can be employed to foster greater consensus and cooperation?** (Focuses on political science, policy implementation, and conflict resolution)
- **How Do We Deal With the Polarization Around Climate Change?**: Politics has always involved disagreements, but polarization in Congress worsened considerably when Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House.
- **The Politics of Climate Change in the United States**: But most Americans support a role for scientists in climate policy, and there is bipartisan support for expanding solar, wind energy Table of Contents Table of Contents PhotoviewPlus/Getty Images Political fissures on climate issues extend far beyond beliefs about whether climate change is occurring and whether humans are playing a role, according to a new, in-depth survey by Pew Research Center. These divisions reach across every dimension of the climate debate, down to people’s basic trust in the motivations that drive climate scientists to conduct their research. Specifically, the survey finds wide political divides in views of the potential for devastation to the Earth’s ecosystems and what might be done to address any climate impacts. This survey extensively explores how peoples’ divergent views over climate issues tie with people’s views about climate scientists and their work.
- **The differential impact of climate interventions along the political ...**: In this work, we find political polarization of climate change beliefs and policy support around the globe, with people who reported being liberal believing

- **Chapter 4: Sea Level Rise and Implications for Low-Lying Islands ...**: Given diverse geographies and contexts (4.1.3), and the pros and cons of different responses, there is no silver bullet for responding to SLR. Rather, each coastal locality requires a tailor-made response that uses an appropriate mix of measures, sequenced over time as sea level rises. Possible integrated response strategies are illustrated for two contrasting types of settlements: densely populated urban and sparsely populated rural coasts. [...] Rising mean and increasingly extreme sea level threaten coastal zones through a range of coastal hazards including (i) the permanent submergence of land by higher mean sea levels or mean high tides; (ii) more frequent or intense coastal flooding; (iii) enhanced coastal erosion; (iv) loss and change of coastal ecosystems; (v) salinisation of soils, ground and surface water; and (vi) impeded drainage. At the century scale and without adaptation, the vast majority of low-lying islands, coasts and [...] Despite the large uncertainty in late 21st century SLR, progress in adaptation planning and implementation is feasible today and may be economically beneficial. Many coastal decisions with time horizons of decades to over a century are made today (e.g., critical infrastructure, coastal protection works, city planning, etc.) and accounting for relative SLR can improve these decisions. Decision-analysis methods specifically targeting situations of large uncertainty are available and, combined
